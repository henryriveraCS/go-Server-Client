<code>Install Go</code>
Start running the server by running <code>go run server.go</code>
<br/>
You can now send bytes to the server by running: <code>go run app.go -msg="Hello World!"</code> (or choose any string you want)

You'll be able to see on the instance running the server that the bytes were received and read. You'll also get a message from the client mentioning that the bytes were successfully sent or if it failed.
