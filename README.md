<h1>Instructions</h1>

<br>Start running the server by using:<code>go run server.go</code></br>
<br/>
Once the server is running you can now send bytes to the server with:<code>go run app.go -msg="Hello World!"</code>(or choose any string you want)
<br />

<p>
You'll be able to see on the instance running the server that the bytes were received and read. You'll also get a message from the client mentioning that the bytes were successfully sent or if it failed.
